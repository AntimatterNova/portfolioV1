            <p>
                Since an early age, I have had an interest in programming. Later on in life, that interest blossomed into writing basic text based story games with batch code. My
                parents took notice of my hobby and put me in a basic web development course in my last year of highschool. After that I entered the coding bootcamp hosted by Kansas University.
                From there, I learned how to utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many more programming languages.
